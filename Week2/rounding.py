# List numbers from 0 to 10, divide by 3,
# print result as 2 decimal places

divisor= 3 
Decimal_places= 2 

for number in range (0, 11):
   # print(round(number/divisor, Decimal_places))
    
    print("This is my rounded result{0:.2f} also this {1:}".format(number/divisor, 5)) #.= decimal 2f= the amount of decimals and that its is a float
